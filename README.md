# GRIP Computer Vision Engine

GRIP (the Graphically Represented Image Processing engine) is a program for rapidly prototyping and deploying computer
vision algorithms, primarily for robotics applications.  **It is currently in an early state of development**,
should be ready in time for the 2016 FIRST Robotics Competition.

## Getting Started

1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP/releases) for your operating system.
2. Run the included installer.
3. Open GRIP

Check out the release notes and [the wiki](https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP/wiki) for more information.
