# GRIP Annotation Processor

This subproject contains an annotation processor used to generate manifest files in the core project,
used by the GRIP runtime to discover operations, publishable data types, and aliases for XStream
serialization for save files.

The annotation processor generates these files:

| Annotation | File |
|---|---|
| `@Description` | `/META-INF/operations` |
| `@PublishableObject` | `/META-INF/publishables` |
| `@XStreamAlias` | `/META-INF/xstream-aliases` |

Each file contains a list of the names of the classes annotated with the corresponding annotation,
which is then read by the `MetaInfReader` class in the GRIP core module.
